# Design system

## Setup
- `npm install`
- `bower install`
- `gulp`

## Todo
- download and serve fonts instead of using Google Fonts
- rework the `rem` mixin to be a bit cleverer (or ditch it entirely)

## Notes
- see if we can get rid of 12px fonts (Apollo & Nike) completely
- buttons don't have an active state yet
- no hover, active or disabled state for .btn-outline
- definitely need to cover form fields, labels, focus/error states, etc
